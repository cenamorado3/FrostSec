    I'm just going to be transperent and show you the code to "Fun" page you were just on. The C# portion is straightforward, instanstiating everything in place, though due to
    that simplicity, it would be equally simple to build persistence in with a database, even manage them via the web page rather than through the database. That's all there is to it.
